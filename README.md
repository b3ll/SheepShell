Sheep Shell
=============

A clean zsh shell theme, powered by emoji (especially sheep 🐑)!

I've always wanted my own custom shell prompt, so now I built one. 

Originally nicknamed "[baaaaaaash](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/413431843460227072)" by [@stroughtonsmith](https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith) and [Sheep Shell](https://twitter.com/buzzert/status/413431752246308865) by [@buzzert](https://twitter.com/buzzert), it features the classic sheep emoji 🐑 (by default).

It also features git / mercurial repository status (clean / dirty), a short path, and vi status.

It also goes great with [Panic Palette](https://github.com/iest/Panic-Palette-Extras) as a colour palette.

## But what if I don't like 🐑?

```
PROMPT_EMOJI="🎉"
```

(You can easily redefine this in your .zshrc.)

## How do I install?
Add sheep_shell.zsh-theme to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/

## License?
Pretty much the BSD license, just **don't** repackage it and call it your own please!

Also if you do make some changes, feel free to make a pull request and help make things more awesome!
